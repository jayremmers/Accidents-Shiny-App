# Accidents-Shiny-App
My shiny app created with traffic accident data

Here is the app I created:
https://jayremmers.shinyapps.io/shinyaccidentnew/ 

This app uses code from traffic accident data in 2021. One plot is a bar chart where you can control the x-variable and the fill variable. This allows comparison of 
two categorical variables using count. This plot can be switched between a bar chart showing count and a percent bar chart that shows count as a part of the whole.
The other plot shows number of accidents at each period of time for each city. This plot can be by month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
